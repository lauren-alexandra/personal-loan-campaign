# Personal Loan Campaign

<table>
<tr>
<td>
  Designed the loan campaign for converting the existing customers to liability customers by building a classification model that identifies the existing customers that are more likely to buy a loan. 
  
  Model performance on Recall: 85.9%. The metric measures the True Positive rate (how accurately the model can identify relevant data). Recall is key; we want to decrease false negatives because the bank wants more customers to take the loan.
